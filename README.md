# Who Said This?
## Philosophy from a data point of view

"One should only speak where one cannot remain silent, and only speak of what one has conquered —the rest is all chatter, “literature,” bad breeding." --Friedrich Nietzsche

I chose this quote from Nietzche not because it strike a particular chord in my heart, instead, I picked it because it set me wondering, what is the idea behind this sentence the philosopher is trying to convey? Luckily, I have data to my aid. To best utilize the data at hand, I decided to address the the challange as a supervised learning problem. Namely, the goal is to develop an algorithm that predict the school of philosophy a given sentence belongs to.

In this project I conducted the following data exploration tasks:

1. Explored different vectorization method to encode text data.
2. Used Naive Bayes model to conduct a classification task on the philosophy dataset.
3. Based on tf-idf technique, explored the influence of feature selection on model performance.
4. Applied text processing and model to real-world test data.
